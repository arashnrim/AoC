# Advent of Code

This repository is where my attempts for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) are stored safely for future reference or other use cases you may have. Currently, it's not known if I'll be able to complete the Advent to its completion considering the possibility of challenges to difficult to solve at my level; nonetheless, I'll try to give my best shot!

## What is Advent of Code?

A brief summary can be found on [its about page](https://adventofcode.com/about):

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

I first came across it when some members of (the amazing) [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) started creating repositories for sharing their solutions to the challenges provided by Advent of Code. I find it interesting to see what programming languages they've employed, and how they've written their program. After all, everyone writes things differently!

## About this repository

I don't expect much to happen during the months that the Advent is unavailable — that is, most of the year from January to November. I also don't expect much contributions to this repository since it is, after all, a personal effort. Even so, feel free to browse through the code! If there's something you'd like to share or comment on, feel free to [reach out](mailto:hello@arashnrim.me)!

This repository has been intentionally given the [Unlicense license](https://unlicense.org) so that you can do practically anything you'd want with the code. Feel free to inspect, edit, and learn (though, I'm not too sure you'd want to do the last option with my code!).

Thanks for stopping by!
